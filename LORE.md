# Lore

The Frontiers mods establish a shared alternative continuity which relies upon the original game's lore unless stated otherwise. Understanding the lore is not necessary to enjoy the mods. It exists solely to enhance the experience by providing additional insight into the way things are the way they are.


## Background

The Cold War never really ended: it kept changing shape, transforming along with advances in technology.

The sustained level of tension around the world has led to accelerated developments in warfare and adjacent technologies. Some of these developments found their way into the civilian world. Some, like military augmented reality, were initiated by it.


### Preparatory Atmosphere

It has also sparked greater interest in various forms of self-sustainance and survivalism, essentially putting them just on this side of mainstream.

Urban survivalist-type merchandise became fairly popular, while EDC (everyday carry) has moved into mainstream, with its more intense forms taking a protesting stance against what their followers perceive is a growing complacency in society.


### Off the Grid

Due to the growing emphasis on preparedness, off-the-grid equipment – such as portable power tools – became more popular and has received a much bigger share of the market.

Lightweight and compact electrical tools have received a similar boost, with additional emphasis being put on the volume of space each such tools takes up. Toolhousing – being able to carry as many of common tools on one's person as compactly as possible – even became a subculture within the EDC community.


### Nuclear Efforts

As longevity and reliability became a point of interest in all aspects of living, public fears of nuclear energy shrunk, which led to development of safe, long-lasting portable sources of power. 

Food irradiation as a method of further food preservation has become commonplace. Though somewhat more expensive than regular counterparts, food pasteurized via irradiation sees extended shelf life. Most foods last a week or two longer due to the sterilizing effect, without any chance in taste or vitamin content. Complete irradiation sterilization – of the sorts used to safeguard food for astronauts – has also become more common along public demand.

Batteries using nuclear decay appeared on the market fairly recently. Their low output makes them unusable for tools, but astonshing longevity – hundreds, if not thousands, of years – means they find extensive use in prepper communities.


### Private Manufacture

The increasing prioritization of independent survival spurred proliferation of self-manufacture tools, materials, and blueprints.

Additive printing saw a stark increase in popularity because it allowed people design and acquire otherwise expensive products with only a bit of upfront investment and some recurring costs of material. Several production giants lobbied to have 3D-printing regulated at one point, but were struck down by the Supreme Court: this sort of regulation, it was ruled, would violate personal rights.

This decision – much publicized at the time – spurred the industry into a golden age. Businesses love stability, and with the additive manufacture industry being brought to its most stable, opportunies soon began to develop and chance started to be taken.

Commercially-available printers for all sorts of materials appeared within a couple of years. Food, textiles, metal, biomedical, circuitry, pharmaceutical – as well as larger-scale, industrial production of houses and vehicles.

The widespread presence of 3D printers also enabled the open-source electronics movement. Things as simple as a humidity sensor and as complex as entire laptops could be produced independently, without markups and with the desired aesthetics. Wearables – watches, heart rate monitors, even wireless paper keyboards – became especially popular.

Despite the two areas requiring a license to print, firearms and drug printing became popular for people less concerned with legislation.


#### Pharmaceutical

The concern for having unregulated medication in the wild prompted legal action from the government. The strict fines, however, did not stop those eager to make some money, or those looking to self-medicate in private.

Under the Controlled Substances Act, the U.S. government monitors illicit drugs, as well as precursor chemicals known to be used in production of those, regardless of the method of manufacture. It may therefore be difficult to acquire those even post-Cataclysm.


#### Firearms

With copyright-infringing blueprints out on the Internet, people could now produce their own guns in the privacy of one's own home, the only requirements being a VPN, materials for the print, and some work to bring it all together afterwards.

3D-printed firearms are illegal to own but are also untraceable, which has caused quite a bit of headache for law enforcement. While the legislation to curb their production helped, it did not stop followers of the Third Doctrine.


### The Three Doctrines

Fears for one's safety along with increasing crime rates in cities led to the development of the Three Doctrines: informal guidelines for common scenarios in which a gun with particular characteristics would be most useful. They became *de facto* standards thanks to being used extensively in marketing by early adopters of the Doctrines.


#### The First Doctrine

The First Doctrine dictates that the walls of one's home are a sacred ground and must be defended at all costs.

The First Doctrine is about reliability and usability in the face of imminent danger. It's about being able to put your gun away for months, and be able to use it in an event of home invasion without hesitation.

Ideal First Doctrine firearms are designed to provide its owner with the absolute certainty of available firepower under pressure. They're often overengineered and are touted to be able to withstand anything short of a nuclear strike.

This kind of design philosophy usually lends itself to sacrifices in other areas: weight, customization, and peripheral uses can be disregarded in exchange for the ability to stand one's ground.

First Doctrine companies primarily advertise to home owners, including those in rural areas. They also often sell common ammunition in bulk; under the right conditions, it will remain usable for decades.


#### The Second Doctrine

The Second Doctrine states that after hell breaks loose, there will be no such thing as a home, because there would be no laws or anyone to enforce them. Therefore, it's paramount that anyone looking to survive is constantly on the move and is able to adapt to present circumstance.

Described as nomadic in part, the Second Doctrine focuses on mobility and doing more with less. Second Doctrine firearms should be as little a burden for their owner to carry around, and allow them to do more with less. This often results in the guns featuring skeletonized parts, reducing the overall weight and size of the gun by as much as possible, making it compact and highly portable.

Instead of focusing on absolute reliability, the Second Doctrine focuses on one's ability to change as their environment changes. Open systems with interchangable parts and easily modifiable potential are the cornerstone of Second Doctrine firearms. Being able to change caliber and engagement distance within minutes is what the doctrine is about.

Accessories made under the Second Doctrine are similarly compact, lightweight, and reliable over long periods of time without repair. Magazines are often plastic, the batteries for electronic attachments are common and replaceable, with as much of bulk shaved off as possible.


#### The Third Doctrine

The Third Doctrine posits that one has the right to defend themselves beyond any law.

The Third Doctrine emphasizes resourcefulness in the face of conflict, without ever specifying with whom said conflict may arise. It focuses on providing its followers with tools of warfare with no regard for legality or public safety.

Third Doctrine firearms range from concealable options which would not cause concern, to self-made ones, including ones impossible to trace. These include pocket-sized .22 pistols, 3D-printed copycats, and assembly kits with ghost receivers, in avoidance of gun regulations. Sharing schematics for handmade firearms is also not uncommon, since "a gun is better than no gun".

In a world where laws still apply, many of the Third Doctrine practices would be immoral at best and illegal at worst. Opinions of the doctrine's advocates – often hiding behind usernames online – ranged from pointing out that self-defence is not illegal, only ownership of unregistered firearms is, to referring the the United States as a police state and using that to justify being able to fire first as a human right.
