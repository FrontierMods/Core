# Frontier Mods

_last updated: Mar 11, 2024_

Frontier Mods is a collection of mods for _Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead_. They're designed to work separately or in conjunction with one another; patches will be provided to bridge functionality between Frontier mods, should their content overlap.

The goal of Frontier Mods is to create an ecosystem of independent, compatible, and ultimately synergetic mods which augment the gameplay by grounding the game in reality and expanding the options available to the player.

_DDA_'s engine does not allow adding extensive functionality via mods; it does, however, permit creating a large amount of content.

Implenenting author-driven expansion of content – independently of the goals of the base game – is the foundation of Frontier Mods.

Frontier Mods also hosts [a blog](https://github.com/FrontierMods/Blog) and [a design document](https://github.com/FrontierMods/Design). Subscribe to those to stay in touch with the development of the mods.

## Game Version Support

The mods are designed to be compatible with the latest stable release only.

Current version supported: **0.G**.

# Frontier Core

**Frontier Core** is the base mod for the entirety of the Frontier Mods collection. It contains features, changes, and bugfixes used by most mods.

## Auditing

**Core** contains a number of audits for the base game's items. Most concern physical dimensions and adding appropriate flags for use with Frontier Mods' other equipment.

Audits are included as necessary. They are not designed to include all mischaracterized items from the base game, since not all items need to be changed.

# Frontier Mods Extra

[Frontier Mods Extra](https://github.com/FrontierModsExtra) are mods that don't fit into the Frontier ecosystem. Extra mods are developed by the same author.

These are usually smaller mods, often experimental in nature, and don't follow the shared lore. Their goal is to speculate and explore.

Extra mods may be absorbed into main Frontier mods later.

# Notes

Many of the mods also include notes and reference documents. These were written during development and shared with other modders for the purposes of expanding the arsenal of ideas.

# Sponsor

Frontiers Mods are developed by a single dedicated person.

While the mods themselves confer no overhead costs – such as, for example, hosting – each takes a considerable amount of time to research, develop, and polish, to say nothing of the post-release support.
