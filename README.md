# Frontier Mods

Frontier Mods is a collection of mods for *Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead*. They're designed to work separately or in conjunction with one another; patches will be provided to bridge functionality between Frontier mods.

Ultimately, the goal of Frontier Mods is to create an ecosystem of interreliable mods which augment the gameplay by expanding the options available to the player, within the limits provided by the base game. *Cataclysm*'s engine does not allow adding functionality via mods; it does, however, permit creating a large amount of content.

Implenenting the author-driven expansion of content – independently of the goals of the base game – is the foundation of Frontier Mods.


## Compatibility

The mods are designed to be compatible with the latest stable release only.

Currently supported: version **0.F**.


# Lore

Most of the Frontier mods follow shared lore. Those that don't, note so in their `README.md` file.

The lore is based off the base game's, in an attempt to expand and enliven its worldbuilding. Together, Frontier Mods create a separate timeline, where the flow of events resulted in a more paranoid, more prepper, and more technologically-advanced world, in an attempt to circumvent or combat the increasing threat in an unstable political environment.

See [`LORE.md`](LORE.md) for a more detailed description of the changes.

Large mods offer their own lore in addition to the shared one. See `LORE.md` in the root directory of each mod.


# Reference

Many of the mods include notes and reference documents. These were written during development and are being shared openly for the purposes of expanding the arsenal of ideas.

Each mod provides its own notes. See `REFERENCE.md` in the root directory of each mod.


# Sponsor

Frontiers Mods are developed by a single person.

While the mods themselves confer no overhead costs – such as, for example, hosting – each takes a considerable amount of time to research, develop, and polish, to say nothing of the post-release support.
