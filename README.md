# What are Frontier Mods

Frontier Mods is a collection of mods for *Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead*. They're designed to work separately or in conjunction with one another; patches will be provided to bridge functionality between Frontier mods.

Ultimately, the goal of Frontier Mods is to create an ecosystem of interreliable mods which augment the gameplay by expanding the options available to the player, within the limits provided by the base game. *Cataclysm*'s engine does not allow adding functionality via mods; it does, however, permit creating a large amount of content.

Implenenting the author-driven expansion of content – independently of the goals of the base game – is the foundation of Frontier Mods.


## Compatibility

The mods are designed to be compatible with the latest stable release only.

Currently supported: version **0.F**.


# Sponsor

Frontiers Mods are developed by a single person.

While the mods themselves confer no overhead costs – such as, for example, hosting – each takes a considerable amount of time to research, develop, and polish, to say nothing of the post-release support.
