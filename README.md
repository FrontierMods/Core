# Frontier Mods

Frontier Mods is a collection of mods for *Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead*. They're designed to work separately or in conjunction with one another; patches will be provided to bridge functionality between Frontier mods.

The goal of Frontier Mods is to create an ecosystem of independent, compatible, and ultimately synergetic mods which augment the gameplay by expanding the options available to the player.

*Cataclysm*'s engine does not allow adding functionality via mods; it does, however, permit creating a large amount of content.

Implenenting the author-driven expansion of content – independently of the goals of the base game – is the foundation of Frontier Mods.

Frontier Mods also hosts [a blog](https://github.com/FrontierMods/Blog) and [a design document](https://github.com/FrontierMods/Design). Subscribe to those to stay in touch with the development of the mods.


## Support

The mods are designed to be compatible with the latest stable release only.

Current version supported: **0.G**.


# Frontier Core

**Frontier Core** is the base mod for the entirety of the Frontier Mods collection. It contains features, changes, and bugfixes used by most mods.


## Flags

Some features ­– modular equipment in particular – operate by relying on flags.

You can find the list of flags and their intended uses in [`/documentation/FRONTIER_FLAGS.md`](/documentation/FRONTIER_FLAGS.md).


## Tool Qualities

Some features ­– including basic disassembly when appropriate mods are installed – operate by relying on flags.

You can find the list of flags and their intended uses in ~~[`/documentation/FRONTIER_TOOL_QUALITIES.md`](/documentation/FRONTIER_TOOL_QUALITIES.md)~~.


## Overrides

**Core** contains a number of overrides for the base game's items. Most of the overrides concern sizing and adding appropriate flags for use with Frontier Mods' other equipment.

Overrides are included as necessary. They are not designed to include all mischaracterized items from the base game, since not all items need to be fixed.

Override files are located in the ~~[`/override/`](/override/)~~ folder.


## Core Content

**Core** also adds a variety of shared content.

The Core content **does not automatically appear in the game** with only **Core** installed. Instead, each Frontier mod dictates spawn points, recipes, and other uses for it. The content's placement into **Core** is required for other mods to be able to use it interoperably


# Frontier Mods Extra

[Frontier Mods Extra](https://github.com/FrontierModsExtra) are mods that don't fit into the Frontier ecosystem. Extra mods are developed by the same author.

These are usually smaller mods, often experimental in nature, and don't follow the shared lore. Their goal is to speculate and explore.

Extra mods may be absorbed into main Frontier mods later.

# Lore

Most of the Frontier mods follow shared lore.

Said lore is based off the base game's, in an attempt to expand and enliven its worldbuilding. Together, Frontier Mods create a separate timeline, where the flow of events resulted in a more paranoid, more prepper, and more technologically-advanced world, in an attempt to circumvent or combat the increasing threat in an unstable political environment.

See [`/documentation/LORE.md`](/documentation/LORE.md) for a more detailed description of the changes.

Large mods offer their own lore in addition to the shared one.


# Notes

Many of the mods also include notes and reference documents. These were written during development and shared with other modders for the purposes of expanding the arsenal of ideas.


# Sponsor

Frontiers Mods are developed by a single person.

While the mods themselves confer no overhead costs – such as, for example, hosting – each takes a considerable amount of time to research, develop, and polish, to say nothing of the post-release support.
